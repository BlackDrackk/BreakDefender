## About us

As engineering students majoring in Cybersecurity, we have to master different aspects of this field. For that, this project is perfect for us because it covers malwares, programming; forensics; antiviruses and phishing attacks. So, it’s an interesting project with many works and research to do.  

The end goal of this project is to bypass windows defender with a malware. It was carried out in previous years by students from ESME Sudria without being completed.
